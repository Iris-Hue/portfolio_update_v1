        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have had a lot of work experience in the health care administration side of things. I got to learn new software programs that taught me how to problem solve on the fly. My first career was working as a hairdresser. What a rewarding job that gave me a chance to work with people. I learned how important it is to listen and understand what someone is trying to communicate. Developing people skills were essential for the return customer clientele.</p>
